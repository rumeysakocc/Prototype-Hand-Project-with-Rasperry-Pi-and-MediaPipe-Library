The Mediapipe library is an open source framework created by Google, used to create machine learning solutions.
One of the most common applications using Mediapipe is Multiple Hand Movement Detection:
Mediapipe can detect the movements of multiple hands at the same time. 
It can also identify 21 landmarks on the hands. In this way, information such as hand shape, direction, angle, posture can be accessed.
As can be seen below, the landmarks of each finger joint and hand regions are defined. 
With the x,y angle values of these points, we can bring the position of the hand into a state that our computer can understand.[1]
